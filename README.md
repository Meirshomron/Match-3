# Match-3

**Made with Unity 2020.3.16f1**

## Intro

Tile matching game. 
<br /> Learn more about this category: [Tile Matching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tile-matching_video_game). 
<br /> I've created independently a match3 style matching game that includes the key popular features of a match 3 game and added a unique twist - the powerup board.
<br /> The powerup board is the yellow-white board of tiles in the bottom left corner of the in-game screen. This board marks the position of all the tiles hit in the main board of tile. Once the player completes hitting a full row or column or 3X3 set of tiles he is granted the ability to use the level's powerups again. 
<br /> The code for this game is included in the repo for educational purposes.
